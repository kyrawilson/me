<p>I am a research assistant in the Neurolinguistics of Language Lab at NYU Abu Dhabi under Drs. Liina Pylkk√§nen and Alec Marantz. I graduated from Carleton College in 2020 with degrees in Linguistics and Computer Science and a minor in Dance. My research interests are syntax and morphology, language documentation and preservation, and language acquisition. When I am not thinking about language, I'm solving/writing crosswords (or trying to), baking, dancing, or watching animal videos. </p>
